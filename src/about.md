# Typst Examples Book
This book provides an extended _tutorial_ and lots of [Typst](https://github.com/typst/typst) snippets that can help you to write better Typst code.

<div class="warning">
    This is an unofficial book. Some snippets & suggestions here may be outdated or useless (please let me know if you find some).
</div>

However, _all of them should compile on last version of Typst[^1]_.

**CAUTION:** currently the book is a **WIP**, so don't rely on it.

If you like it, consider [giving a star on GitHub](https://github.com/sitandr/typst-examples-book)!

This will greatly help me to stay motivated and continue working on this book!

## Navigation
The book consists of several chapters, each with its own goal:

1. [Typst Basics](./basics/index.md)
2. [Typst Snippets](./snippets/index.md)
3. [Typst Packages](./packages/index.md)
4. [Typstonomicon](./typstonomicon/index.md)

## Contributions
Any contributions are very welcome! If you have a good code snippet that you want to share, feel free to submit an issue with snippet or make a PR in the [repository](https://github.com/sitandr/typst-examples-book).

I will especially appreciate submissions of active community members and compiler contributors!
However, I will also very appreciate feedback from beginners to make the book as comprehensible as possible!

## Acknowledgements
Thanks to everyone in the community who published their code snippets!

If someone doesn't like their code and/or name being published, please contact me.

[^1]: When a new version launches, it may take a few days to update the book, but not much more.
