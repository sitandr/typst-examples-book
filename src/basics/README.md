# Typst Basics

This is a chapter that consistently introduces you to the most things you need to know when writing with Typst.

It show much more things than official tutorial, so maybe it will be interesting to read for some of the experienced users too.

Some examples are taken from [Official Tutorial](https://typst.app/docs/tutorial/) and [Official Reference](https://typst.app/docs/reference/).
Most are created and edited specially for this book.

> _Important:_ in most cases there will be used "clipped" examples of your rendered documents (no margins, smaller width and so on). 
> 
> To set up the spacing as you want, see corresponding example section [WIP]() and [Official Page Setup Guide](https://typst.app/docs/guides/page-setup-guide/).
